You’ll find this post in your `content/posts` directory.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `content/posts` directory that follows the convention `name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea of how it works.

Hugo also offers powerful support for code snippets:

    package main
    import "fmt"
    func print_hi(name string) {
      fmt.Println("Hi, ", name)
    }
    
    func main() {
      print_hi("Tom")
    }
    //=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
